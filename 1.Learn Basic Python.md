## 1. Introduction
A power to create anything.
* Python is a simple programming language
* It is cross-platform
* A high level langauge
* An interpreted language
* It is extensible

> Python language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”

## 2. Installing Python
Download the latest version for
* Mac OS | https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/
* Windows | https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
* Linux/UNIX | https://www.python.org/downloads/source/
* Other | https://www.python.org/download/other/

## 3. Python Interpreter
#### Linux/Unix Systems
Usually in Terminal based systems it is installed in path ```/usr/local/bin/python```.Set ```/usr/local/bin``` in Linux/Unix shell search path. 
#### On Windows
The Python installation is usually placed in ```C:\Python```.Setting path in Environment variables or ```set path=%path%;C:\Python36``` in CMD DOS will complete the installation.

Type ```python``` in terminal shell or command prompt to start working.
```
Python 3.6.2 (v3.6.2:5fd33b5, Jul  8 2017, 04:57:36) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```
This is the ```python interactive shell```. It indicates the python version 3.6.2 installed on Windows 32-bit.
```three greater-than signs (>>>)``` is the primary prompt.

## 4. Basic Commands
We use print method to output on console.
```
>>> print("Hello")
Hello
>>> print('Hello World')
Hello World
>>> print(123+456)
579
```
Variable creation is easy without declaring the type of variable.
```
>>> num=1
>>> num
1
>>> a = 2
>>> print('a prints out ', a)
a prints out 2
>>> str="Character & String"
>>> str
'Character & String'
```
## 5. Basic Functions
Stucture of function defination
Syntax would go like this-
```
>>> def FunctionName(parameter1, parameter2,....):
algorithm statements..
return SomeData
```

To creat user define functions and import the functions
```
>>> def defaultArg( name): 
        print name
```
function call
```
>>> defaultArg(aniket)
```
Function call with arguments
```
>>> def default(name, msg="Hello"):
        print name
```
Function Call
```
>>> default(name)
```

## 6.Networking in python

Python provides two levels of access to network services. At a low level, you can access the basic socket support in the underlying operating system, which allows you to implement clients and servers for both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols.

Python also has libraries that provide higher-level access to specific application-level network protocols, such as FTP, HTTP, and so on.

## What is Sockets?

Sockets are the endpoints of a bidirectional communications channel. Sockets may communicate within a process, between processes on the same machine, or between processes on different continents.

## The socket Module

```
s = socket.socket (socket_family, socket_type, protocol=0)
```

Here is the description of the parameters −

    socket_family − This is either AF_UNIX or AF_INET, as explained earlier.

    socket_type − This is either SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM.

    protocol − This is usually left out, defaulting to 0.
