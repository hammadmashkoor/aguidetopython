## 1. Introduction
A power to create anything.
* Python is a simple programming language
* It is cross-platform
* A high level langauge
* An interpreted language
* It is extensible

> Python language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”

## 2. Installing Python
Download the latest version for
* Mac OS | https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/
* Windows | https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
* Linux/UNIX | https://www.python.org/downloads/source/
* Other | https://www.python.org/download/other/

## 3. Python Interpreter
#### Linux/Unix Systems
Usually in Terminal based systems it is installed in path ```/usr/local/bin/python```.Set ```/usr/local/bin``` in Linux/Unix shell search path. 
#### On Windows
The Python installation is usually placed in ```C:\Python```.Setting path in Environment variables or ```set path=%path%;C:\Python36``` in CMD DOS will complete the installation.

Type ```python``` in terminal shell or command prompt to start working.
```
Python 3.6.2 (v3.6.2:5fd33b5, Jul  8 2017, 04:57:36) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```
This is the ```python interactive shell```. It indicates the python version 3.6.2 installed on Windows 32-bit.
```three greater-than signs (>>>)``` is the primary prompt.

## 4. Basic Commands
We use print method to output on console.
```
>>> print("Hello")
Hello
>>> print('Hello World')
Hello World
>>> print(123+456)
579
```
Variable creation is easy without declaring the type of variable.
```
>>> num=1
>>> num
1
>>> a = 2
>>> print('a prints out ', a)
a prints out 2
>>> str="Character & String"
>>> str
'Character & String'
```
## 5. Basic Functions
Stucture of function defination
Syntax would go like this-
```
>>> def FunctionName(parameter1, parameter2,....):
algorithm statements..
return SomeData
```

To creat user define functions and import the functions
```
>>> def defaultArg( name): 
        print name
```
function call
```
>>> defaultArg(aniket)
```
Function call with arguments
```
>>> def default(name, msg="Hello"):
        print name
```
Function Call
```
>>> default(name)
```

# Python Modules

A file containing Python code, for e.g.: example.py, is called a module and its module name would be example.

We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files. Furthermore, modules provide reusability of code.

We can define our most used functions in a module and import it, instead of copying their definitions into different programs.
````
#Python Module example

def add(a, b):
   """This program adds two
   numbers and return the result"""

   result = a + b
   return result
````   
   Here, we have defined a function add() inside a module named example. 
   The function takes in two numbers and returns their sum.
